<h2 id="the-most-probable-value-of-r">3.26, 3.27 The most probable value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span></h2>
<p>The sequence <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span> for fixed <span class="math inline">\(N, M, n\)</span> is unimodal, meaning it first increases, then decreases. To see this we argue as follows.</p>
<p>We want to see wether <span class="math inline">\(h(r+1|N, M, n)\)</span> is bigger than <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span>, so we need to compare their fraction to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. We compute using 3.22</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[h(r+1|N, M, n)/h(r|N, M, n)=\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{(M-r) /(r+1)}{(N-M - n+ r+1) /(n-r)}=\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{(r-M) (r-n)}{(r+1)(r+ N-M-n+1 )  }  \stackrel{?}{\gtreqless} 1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(r-M) (r-n)\stackrel{?}{\gtreqless}(r+1)(r+ N-M-n+1 ) \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Mn-(M+n)r  \stackrel{?}{\gtreqless} (N-M-n+1) +r (N-M-n+2)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Mn-(N-M-n+1) \stackrel{?}{\gtreqless}  r (N+2)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{ Mn-(N-M-n+1)}{N+2} \stackrel{?}{\gtreqless}  r \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{ Mn+M+n+1}{N+2} \stackrel{?}{\gtreqless}  r+1 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{ (M+1)(n+1)}{N+2} \stackrel{?}{\gtreqless}  r+1 \]</span></p>
<p>The sequence <span class="math inline">\(h(r)\)</span> increases while the left hand side is bigger.</p>
<p>Thus denoting by <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;\)</span> the number <span class="math inline">\(\frac{ (M+1)(n+1)}{N+2}\)</span> we see that if <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;\)</span> is an integer, then <span class="math inline">\(h(r)\)</span> increase until <span class="math inline">\(r=r&#39;-1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(h(r&#39;-1)=h(r&#39;)\)</span>, then the <span class="math inline">\(h(r)\)</span> decrease. If <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;\)</span> is not an integer, then <span class="math inline">\(h(r)\)</span> increase until <span class="math inline">\(h(INT(r&#39;))\)</span>, then decrease.</p>
<p>Remak 1: Note that the expected number of red balls is just the “naive” <span class="math inline">\(n \frac{M}{N}\)</span> (this is not hard to show using linearity of expectation, see Example 4.2.3 in Blitzstein-Hwang “Introduction to Probability”).</p>
<p>Remark 2: The above result can be restated in the following way: pretend to add one red and one white ball to the urn (for a total of <span class="math inline">\(N+2\)</span>) and draw <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> balls from the resulting urn. Compute the “naive” most likely fraction of red balls <span class="math inline">\(\frac{M+1}{N+2}\)</span> and the “naive” most likely number of red balls <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(n+1)(M+1)}{N+2}\)</span>. Now subtract <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. This is (up to rounding) the most likely number of red balls drawn in the original procedure. This seems somewhat reminiscent of the correction that putting a beta prior on Bernoulli makes to the posterior expectation, but I have no idea if there is more to this connection than that.</p>
<h2 id="symmetry-of-hrn-m-n">3.29 Symmetry of <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span></h2>
<p>Combinatorial proof that <span class="math display">\[h(r|N, M, n)=h(r|N, n, M).\]</span></p>
<p>Remark: This is Theorem 3.4.5 in Blitzstein - Hwang “Introduction to Probability”. See also Theorem 3.9.2.</p>
<p>By definition, <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span> is computed as follows. Lay down <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> balls, labeled <span class="math inline">\(1, ..., N\)</span>. Pick the subset <span class="math inline">\(R_0=\{1,..., M\}\)</span> of them and paint it red. Then pick a subset <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of all the ball, and compute <span class="math inline">\(r=|D\cap R_0|\)</span>. The fraction of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>s that give specific answer <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is by definition <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose instead we pick a different subset <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be red, and repeat the procedure above: pick <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and compute <span class="math inline">\(r=|D \cap R_1|\)</span>. We claim that the fraction of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>s that give specific answer <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is still <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span>. In deed, there exists a permutation of <span class="math inline">\(\{1, ..., N\}\)</span> taking <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> (“sort the reds to be first”); the same permutation takes <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>s that give <span class="math inline">\(D\cap R_1=r\)</span> to those that give <span class="math inline">\(D\cap R_0=r\)</span>. Hence there are the same number of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>s in both circumstances.</p>
<p>The above argument means that <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span> can be also computed as follows. Lay down <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> balls, labeled <span class="math inline">\(1, ..., N\)</span>. Pick <strong>any</strong> subset <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> of them of size <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and paint it red. Then pick a subset <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of all the ball, and compute <span class="math inline">\(r=|D\cap R|\)</span>. The fraction of <strong><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>s and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>s</strong> that give specific answer <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is then <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, M, n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>But the above procedure remains the same if we exchange <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and rename “paint red” into “pick” and “pick” into “paint red”. Then it computes <span class="math inline">\(h(r|N, n, M)\)</span>. So the two numbers are equal.</p>
<p>Remark: This view of hypergeometric distribution as giving probabilities of overlap of two subsets (“the red” and “the picked”) removes all time dependence and, in my opinion, sheds a lot of light on the discussion at the end of Section 3.2.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-3.4">Exercise 3.4</h2>
<p>Denote by <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> be the event “<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is fixed”, and, for any <span class="math inline">\(I \subset \{1, ..., n\}\)</span>, denote by <span class="math inline">\(F_I\)</span> the event “all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> are fixed”, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(F_I=\prod_{i\in I} F_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>We are looking for <span class="math inline">\(P(\sum F_i)\)</span>. By inclusion exclusion this is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\sum F_i)=\sum_{I \subset \{1, ..., n\}, I\neq \emptyset} (-1)^{|I|+1}P(F_I).\]</span></p>
<p>For a given subset of size <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> probability that it is fixed is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(n-k)!}{n!}\)</span>, and there are <span class="math inline">\(n\choose k\)</span> such subsets, so the sum over those <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> with size <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k!}\)</span>. Plugging this in we obtain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[h=P(\sum F_i)=\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k!},\]</span> as wanted.</p>
<p>Observe that <span class="math inline">\(1-h\)</span> is the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th order Taylor series for <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span> evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(x=-1\)</span>, which, as <span class="math inline">\(k\to \infty\)</span>, converges to <span class="math inline">\(e^{-1}=1/e\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-3.5">Exercise 3.5</h2>
<p>Similarly to 3.4, consider the event <span class="math inline">\(E_I\)</span>=the bins with labels <span class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span> are left empty; then <span class="math inline">\(P(E_I)= (M-|I|)^N/M^N\)</span> and by inclusion-exclusion <span class="math inline">\(P(\overline{\sum E_i})\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{M^N}\sum_{k=0}^{M} (-1)^{k} \binom{M}{k} (M-k)^N.\]</span></p>
<p>Remark: We are computing probability that a function from a set of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to a set of size <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is onto. There are <span class="math inline">\(M^N\)</span> total functions, and the number of surjective ones is <span class="math inline">\(M!\)</span> times a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind">Stirling number of second kind</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-exercise-3.6">Some of Exercise 3.6</h2>
<p>Remark: If the initial distribution (for <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(P(red)=P(R_0)=p,\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(P(white)=P(\bar{R}_0)=q\)</span>) were the same as the limit distribution <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> (formula 3.125, <span class="math inline">\(\pi(red)=\lim P(R_k)=\frac{p-\delta}{1-\epsilon-\delta},\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\pi(white)=\lim P(\bar{R}_k)=\frac{q-\epsilon}{1-\epsilon-\delta}\)</span>), this would be a steady state Markov chain, whose time-reverse process is also a Markov chain with transition probabilities <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}^r=\frac{\pi_j}{\pi_i}M_{ji}\)</span> (note that for 2 state chains one always has <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}^r=M_{ij}\)</span>). This is precisely condition 3.131. Under this condition it is easy to compute <span class="math inline">\(P(R_j|R_k)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(j&lt;k\)</span>, and in the 2-state case that we are considering, they would be the same as <span class="math inline">\(P(R_k|R_j)\)</span> (as in 3.134). However in this exercise the Markov chain starts from the initial distribution that, in general, is not the steady state distribution, so reversing the time produces a process (indexed by negative integers) which is a Markov chain which is not time-homogeneous. Maybe there is still a way to apply general theory of Markov chains to the problem of “backward inference” in this setting; absent that, we proceed by a direct computation (but observe that the reversed process is connected to the limiting behavior of the result, see below).</p>
<p>As usual, all probabilities are conditioned on <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Equation 3.129 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(R_k |R_j) P(R_j) = P(R_j |R_k) P(R_k) \]</span></p>
<p>Equation 3.118 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(R_k)=\frac{(p-\delta)+(\epsilon+\delta)^{k-1} (p \epsilon-q\delta)}{1-\epsilon-\delta}\]</span></p>
<p>Finally equation 3.128 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(R_k|R_j)=\frac{(p-\delta)+(\epsilon+\delta)^{k-j} (q- \epsilon)}{1-\epsilon-\delta}\]</span></p>
<p>Plugging in</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(R_j |R_k)=  \frac{(p-\delta)+(\epsilon+\delta)^{j-1} (p \epsilon-q\delta)} {(p-\delta)+(\epsilon+\delta)^{k-1} (p \epsilon-q\delta)} \frac{(p-\delta)+(\epsilon+\delta)^{k-j} (q- \epsilon)}{1-\epsilon-\delta}\]</span></p>
<p>If both <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> go to infinity but <span class="math inline">\(k-j\)</span> is kept constant, this converges to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(R_{\infty+d} |R_{\infty})=\frac{(p-\delta)+(\epsilon+\delta)^{d} (q- \epsilon)}{1-\epsilon-\delta},\]</span></p>
<p>which is precisely the “reversed process” result (for large <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> the influence of the initial distribution not being the stationary one has dissipated; in the 2 state case the reversed process is the same as the forward one, but that’s a special feature; when the number of states (i.e. colors) is higher limit behavior of “backward inference” is given by the reversed process).</p>
