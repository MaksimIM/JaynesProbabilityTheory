# Mathematical formalities and style

$\leftarrow$ [Back to Chapters](./index.html)


<!--- In this writer's opinion this appendix serves as a good illustration of a kind of thing a non-specialist may write about an adjacent field whose methods and ideas they have failed to assimilate fully. I ask the reader of these notes to use their judgement in selecting whatever insights -- and in ignoring whatever non-sense  -- may be found here; and to use their empathy in forgiving me my foibles, just as I forgive Jaynes the contents of this appendix.
