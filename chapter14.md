#Simple applicatons of decision theory.

### Comments on 14.1 and 14.2

On p. 428 Jaynes seems to be describing a simple probabilistic graphical model (and is making some analogy between belief propagation in a PGM and Huygens principle).


$Y$ --- $V$ --- $D$

Then $V$ screens $D$ from $Y$ and also screens $Y$ from $D$.

### Comments on 14.4

Small nitpick: There is a discrepancy between the caption of Fig 14.1 and the text ($L_a=2, L_r=1$ gives $L_a=2L_r$ and not $L_a=(3/2)L_r$).

A key point seems to be that (in the example at hand) both the minimax and Neyman-Pearson decision rules are reproduced by a Bayesian decision rule with appropriate prior. It would be interesting to know how general this phenomenon is. I guess by Wald's theorem one only needs to show that minimax/Neyman-Pearson is an dmissible decision rule, as Jaynes says: "Wald showed in great generality what we have just illustrated by one simple example".


### Comments on 14.7

Seems like in the real world the fact that an order for 40 green widgets came -- 4 times the average daily order size! --  in _may_ indicate that the green widget shortage is looming (or something like that). This _might_ give one some impetus to make green ones after all...
