<p>#Paradoxes of probability theory</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\leftarrow\)</span> <a href="./index.html">Back to Chapters</a></p>
<h3 id="comments.">Comments.</h3>
<p>Here is a mathematical take: Since no contradiction in mainstream mathematics has been fount yet, there are no actual paradoxes. There are two types of things that get called “paradoxes”: 1) unintuitive results (a la Banach-Tarski theorem) and 2) fallacious arguments, resulting in incorrect conclusions.</p>
<p>The “paradoxes” of the first type are useful in order refine one’s intuition: they shed light on the framework on is operating in (in the case of Banach-Tarski, roughly speaking, mesaure theory), elucidating this framework’s strengths or weaknesses (in the case of Banach-Tarski, restriction to measurable sets). One is then free to reject the framework or to keep it – augmented with appropriate warning labels about the range of its validity.</p>
<p>The “paradoxes” of the second type (like inappropriately “summing” infinite sequences to prove <span class="math inline">\(0=1\)</span>) are useful in highlighting non-obvious errors and, hopefully, preventing one from committing similar errors later. Thus, one learns not to do unjustified things. One then may also learn, separately, how to do things in a more appropriate way. In the specific example of “summing infinite sequences” we say that one learns mathematical analysis – a more appropriate and contradiction-free (as far as we know) framework. Failure to use analysis properly does not constitute an indictment of methods of analysis – an ironic parallel with the statements Jaynes makes about critics of Bayeseanism.</p>
<p>### Comments on 15.3 – 15.6.</p>
<p>What Jaynes is arguing, in effect, is that finitely-additive axiomatization is too weak, as manifest by the fact that it allows pathologies like “nonconglomerability”. This means that some other axiomatization is needed; the mainstream mathematicians of today seem to agree, as it is the countably-additive axioms that are universally taught to students.</p>
<p>It is a curious linguistic phenomenon: who is “more careful” 1) the mathematician who works with weaker axioms, so as to not put in more assumptions than they deem justified OR 2) the mathematician works with more restrictive axioms, so as to avoid “pathological” examples allowed by the more permissive axioms. I’ll leave the judgement up to linguist (though Jaynes seems to have a particular position).</p>
<p>Indeed, “nonconglomerability” is a phenomenon that does not appear in mainstream probability theory – the paper of Kadane, Schervish and Seidenfeld, to which this section addresses itself, is explisitely set in the context of finitely-additive, but not countably additive, probability. In fact, one of the points of the KSS paper is to advocate for finitely-additive measures (despite their “pathologies” like nonconglomerability) as good fit for Bayesean framework (in particular for their ability to handle improper non-informative priors).</p>
<p>One way of reading section 15.3 is to see it as an argument against both the finitely-additive and countably-additive approaches, pointing out that some alternative, third way of thinking about probability is needed, perhaps more directly based on the “taking the limit in the end” idea. Coming up with a rigorous (which is to say, fully specified) version of such an alternative theory is an interesting, but unsolved and probably difficult question.</p>
<p>### Exercise 15.1</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(N(l, a)\)</span> be the number of sequences of results producing a specific record <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> in with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> annihilations (that is, in <span class="math inline">\(l+2a\)</span> tosses). We will find a recursion relation for <span class="math inline">\(N(l, a)\)</span> (which will also establish that this number depends on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> only via <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, and so is well-defined). Now, clearly,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N(l, 0)=1.\]</span></p>
<p>Observe that <span class="math inline">\(N(1, a)\)</span> is independent of the one character <span class="math inline">\(x=\alpha\)</span> – given any sequence generating some other <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}=\hat{\alpha}\)</span> we can relabel the characters to get a sequence generating <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and vice versa, establishing a bijection between the sequances generating <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha}\)</span>.</p>
<p>(In group theoretic language, we are studying paths in the Cayley graph of the free group on 2 generators <span class="math inline">\(e, \mu\)</span>; we will call all four of the <span class="math inline">\(e=e^+, e^{-1}=e^-, \mu=\mu^+, \mu^{-1}=\mu^-\)</span> “generators”. The groups admits an automorphism sending any generator <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to any other generator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha}\)</span>; this automorphism produces an automorphism of the Cayley graph and hence bijections on paths from the identity to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and paths from identity to <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha}\)</span>. )</p>
<p>Now, observe that <span class="math display">\[N(0, a)=4N(1, a-1),\]</span></p>
<p>because the way to obtain empty word in the end is to start with some symbol <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (4 options), and then produce a word that is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1}\)</span>, which one can do in <span class="math inline">\(N(1, a-1)\)</span> ways.</p>
<p>Finally, for all <span class="math inline">\(l\geq 1\)</span> one we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N(l, a)=N(l-1, a)+3N(l+1, a-1),\]</span></p>
<p>because the first toss either produces the first symbol in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> – after which one has to generate the rest of the symbols of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> annihilations; or it produces one of 3 other symbols, after which one has to produce the inverse of that symbol and then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(a-1\)</span> annihilations (one annihilation being taken up by cancelling the first tossed symbol with its inverse).</p>
<p>Thus we have our recurrence relation and boundary conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N(l, 0)=1\]</span> <span class="math display">\[N(0, a)=4N(1, a-1)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[N(l, a)=N(l-1, a)+3N(l+1, a-1)\]</span></p>
<!---(Note that if we but $N(l, a)=N(|l|, a)$ for $l<0$ the relation in second line becomes identical with the one on the third line.)--->
<p>The problem asks for <span class="math inline">\(N(20, 10)\)</span>. A small dynamic programming script gives <span class="math inline">\(38 192 689 856 872\approx0.4\times10^{14}\)</span>.</p>
